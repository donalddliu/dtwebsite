            During audition, each dancer will be taught a short piece. After all
            auditions are submitted, the choreographers will select their
            dancers and create a weekly rehearsal schedule. We attempt to
            incorporate as many dancer conflicts as possible. Results are

          <p>
            On Saturday, we will provide a video teaching a short choreography.
            Each of the choreographer will provide a video of a snippet of their
            dance, talk about their music choices and the type of dancers they
            are looking for. This process gives prospective dancers a chance to
            watch all the dances for the term and decide which to audition for.

            Each dancer must fill out an online preference sheet. Each sheet

            submitted by the audition submittion deadline (Sunday, 5:00PM).

            Remember, this is a fun process, so do not worry about how well you
            perform! Choreographers are mostly looking for potential and dancing
            ability, not your ability to perfectly perform the audition piece,
            so just try to show off what you have, rather than worrying about
            hitting every move precisely.

            On Saturday, choreographer showcases are held. Each of the
            choreographers will demonstrate a snippet of their dance, talk about
            their music choices and the type of dancers they are looking for.

          <h3>Sunday - Audition</h3>
          <p>
            On Sunday, the full audition process begins. Each dancer is assigned
            an audition number corresponding to your preference sheet.
	      <ul>
        <li>Dancers auditioning for tap dances should participate in the

          </p>

          <h3>Audition Process</h3>
          <p>
            For each audition, dancers will be taught a short piece. After
            teaching (about 30 - 40 minutes), dancers will perform the audition
            piece in groups of 10 - 15 for all of the choreographers.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all auditions are complete, the choreographers will select
            their dancers and create a weekly rehearsal schedule. We attempt to
            incorporate as many dancer conflicts as possible. Results are
